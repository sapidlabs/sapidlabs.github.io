There are couple of new features introduced to Ruby 2.7-preview, so we thought we should give it a try! You can do as well as we do.

Lets get started

As per the post on ruby lang news page, [Official announcement](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/05/30/ruby-2-7-0-preview1-released/). The release announced, talks about various new features and performance improvements. The Final release is planned for December, 2019.

Most notably of amoung them are:

### REPL Improvements
REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, the regular IRB console that you used to try out ruby for the first time. It has finally got some required features. Let me tell you it will be a huge success for all those who are trying to learn ruby or just trying it for the first time.

After these changes are available, you will able to scroll up through your classes/methods that you are trying to test on IRB, which you were unable to do on previous versions.
