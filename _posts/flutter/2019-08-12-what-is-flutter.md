![Flutter - What is Flutter by Sapidlabs][flutter]


[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is Free and Open Source project, and is developed and maintained by Google and is one of the reason why we loved Flutter. Flutter provides beautiful pre-build components which are called Widgets in flutter. Everything in flutter is a [Widget](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)!

### Why use flutter?

We found various reason why one should be opting for flutter:
<br />
#### Faster development

Yes !! Flutter is fast. One of the reason we choose to try out is its simplicity and faster development cycles.

<br />
#### Both for iOS and Android

With flutter, you can reduce the overall development time and obviously some money on two separate app developments.

<br />

#### Best for Startups

With so many startups eagerly waiting to rollout their product to the market. Flutter is an awesome choice for app development.

<br />

#### Built on Dart

Flutter is built on top of dart, which is another object oriented duck typed language, which is used to develop flutter on top of C/C++ engine running behind the overall architecture of flutter.

### Announcement Everyone !!

 We recently contributed to flutter's community by creating a new flutter package called [ListGroup](https://pub.dev/packages/list_group) which provides ListGroup in flutter. Check how it is helping flutter developers all across the globe.
